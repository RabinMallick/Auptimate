#Components of the System:

Data Ingestion Layer: 
This layer is responsible for collecting and ingesting transaction data in real-time from various sources. 
It might include APIs, streaming data sources, or databases. 
We can use technologies like Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar, or AWS Kinesis for stream processing.

Data Processing Layer: 
This layer processes the incoming data stream in real-time. 
It analyzes the data and detects unusual activities based on the defined criteria. 
It can be implemented using a stream processing framework like Apache Flink, Apache Kafka Streams etc.

Alerting Engine: 
The alerting engine is responsible for generating alerts when unusual activities are detected. 
It should have the capability to send notifications to fund managers. We can use technologies like Apache Spark, Apache Samza, 
or custom code for this component.

Data Storage: 
For historical analysis and audit purposes, we may need to store processed data. 
This can be done using databases or data lakes. Technologies like Apache Hadoop, 
Apache Cassandra, or cloud storage solutions can be employed.



#Key Algorithms and Data Structures:

Threshold-Based Alerting: 
To detect single transactions exceeding a pre-defined threshold, we can maintain a sliding window of recent transactions 
and calculate the moving average and standard deviation. 
When a new transaction is significantly higher than the average 
(e.g., several standard deviations away),it will trigger an alert.

Spike Detection: 
To detect a sudden spike in the number of transactions, we can use a rolling time window. 
We will maintain a count of transactions within this window and compare it to the historical average. 
A significant increase in the transaction rate can trigger an alert.

Data Structures: 
We can use data structures like queues, sets, maps, and sliding windows to efficiently process and analyze the incoming data stream. 
For example, a priority queue can be used to keep track of transactions with the highest amounts.



#Real-Time Processing Challenges:

Latency: 
Real-time processing systems should provide low-latency processing to ensure timely alerting. 
We need to optimize the processing pipeline for minimal delay.

Scalability: 
The system should handle a growing number of transactions. 
We can use a distributed architecture and consider auto-scaling based on load.


Fault Tolerance: 
We will implement fault tolerance mechanisms to ensure the system continues to function in the presence of failures.

Data Consistency: 
We will ensure data consistency and reliability in a distributed and real-time environment.

Alert duplication: 
We will handle alert duplication to prevent multiple notifications for the same event.

Integration: 
We will integrate it with notification services to deliver alerts to fund managers, such as email, SMS, or push notifications.



#Pseudocode demonstrating the core logic of the system:

Initialize:
- Define threshold values for unusual transactions and spike detection.
- Create data structures (e.g., sliding windows) for processing.

While true:  // Continuous processing
    // Data Ingestion Layer
    transaction = receiveTransaction()  // Receive transactions from the data source

    // Data Processing Layer
    updateSlidingWindows(transaction)  // Update sliding windows for threshold and spike detection
    detectUnusualTransactions()  // Check for transactions exceeding the threshold
    detectSuddenSpikes()  // Check for sudden spikes in the transaction rate

    // Alerting Engine
    if unusualTransactionDetected:
        generateUnusualTransactionAlert()
    if spikeDetected:
        generateSpikeAlert()

    // Data Storage (optional)
    storeProcessedData()

    // Sleep or set a processing frequency to control the rate of processing

Function updateSlidingWindows(transaction):
    // Update sliding windows with transaction data
    Add transaction to the sliding window for threshold-based alerting
    Add transaction timestamp to the sliding window for spike detection

Function detectUnusualTransactions():
    // Calculate moving average and standard deviation
    Calculate moving average of transaction amounts
    Calculate standard deviation of transaction amounts

    if currentTransactionAmount > (movingAverage + threshold * standardDeviation):
        unusualTransactionDetected = true

Function detectSuddenSpikes():
    // Calculate transaction rate within a rolling time window
    Calculate the transaction rate within the rolling time window
    Calculate the historical average transaction rate

    if transactionRate > (10 * historicalAverageRate):
        spikeDetected = true

Function generateUnusualTransactionAlert():
    // Generate and send alerts for unusual transactions
    Create an alert message for the unusual transaction
    Send the alert to fund managers

Function generateSpikeAlert():
    // Generate and send alerts for spikes in transaction rate
    Create an alert message for the spike
    Send the alert to fund managers

Function storeProcessedData():
    // Store processed data for historical analysis (if needed)
    Store transaction and alert data in a database or data lake

Function receiveTransaction():
    // Receive transaction data from the data source
    Wait for incoming transaction data
    Return the received transaction
